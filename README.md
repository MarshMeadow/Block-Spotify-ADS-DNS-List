# üéß Spotify Ads DNS Blocklist

A powerful DNS blocklist to remove Spotify ads and tracking services. This list includes domains used by Spotify to deliver audio ads and collect tracking data. By adding this list to your DNS blocker (Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, or NextDNS), you can enjoy a cleaner Spotify experience without interruptions.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

Spotify serves ads through specific domains. By blocking these domains, the ads will not be served, which can result in an ad-free experience. This list focuses on blocking:
- **Ad-serving domains**: Prevents Spotify from delivering audio ads.
- **Tracking domains**: Blocks services that collect analytics and user behavior data.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Using this blocklist may violate Spotify‚Äôs terms of service. Use at your own risk. Blocking too aggressively may cause issues with the app, such as playback problems or incomplete functionality.
