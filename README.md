# üéß Spotify Ads DNS Blocklist

A powerful DNS blocklist designed to block Spotify ads and tracking services. This list includes domains used by Spotify to deliver ads and collect user data. By adding this blocklist to your DNS blocking service (such as Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, or NextDNS), you can enjoy an ad-free Spotify experience.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

Spotify uses specific domains to serve ads and track user activity. By blocking these domains at the DNS level, Spotify won't be able to deliver ads or collect tracking data.

### Blocklist Focus:
- **Ad-serving domains**: Blocks domains that deliver audio ads.
- **Tracking domains**: Blocks domains that collect user analytics and behavior.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Blocking ads may violate Spotify‚Äôs terms of service. Use this blocklist at your own risk. Over-blocking may cause functionality issues, such as playback problems.
